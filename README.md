## Information
This is a "poster" system designed to allow people to create their own posters and draw them on any vertically flat surface. There are already a few of these systems out there, but I wanted to share a version that is free, and only requires really one dependancy (ox_lib).
This has QBCore code with ox_inventory items, feel free to fork and make your own framework/inventory version, I will not do so for you!

This version does not require you to input any image size data, it is automatically captured by the images url. All you need is a valid image URL. Thats it. The DUI will be created based on the images actual size. 

This system is great for "graffiti" tagging, advertising your player owned business, etc. 

## Dependencies
- ox_lib
- QBCore or ESX
- ox_inventory or qb-inventory
  
As I stated above, feel free to rework this how you would like with your own systems.
